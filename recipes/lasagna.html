        <li>onions</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li> crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>tomato paste</li>
        <li>ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a large baking dish with olive oil.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat. Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic, sautéing until they become soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until it's browned and cooked through. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and tomato paste into the skillet with the meat mixture. Season with salt, pepper, and a handful of torn fresh basil leaves. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, prepare the cheese filling. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, half of the shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and a couple of beaten eggs. Mix well until it forms a creamy and smooth mixture.</li>
        <li>Now, it's time to assemble the lasagna layers. Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of the greased baking dish. Place lasagna noodles over the sauce, covering the entire surface.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of the cheese mixture on top of the noodles, spreading it evenly. Repeat the process, alternating between the meat sauce and cheese layers, until you've used up all the ingredients. Make sure to finish with a layer of the meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella and some additional grated Parmesan cheese over the final layer of sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese on top turns golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once the lasagna is done, let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves for a delightful finishing touch. Enjoy your mouthwatering homemade lasagna!</li>
